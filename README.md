# Fakestore - an eHouse Studio Dev Assessment

The project I was tasked with completing was a frontend buildout of the homepage of a mock store--Fakestore. The homepage includes a header, hero section, various featured sections, value icons, and though not included in the original mockup, I've also built out a very simple copyright/footer section.

> **Note:** This is my second, and in my opinion, best attempt at this project. After completing this, I feel as though this much more closely reflects my skillset as a developer.

The live page can be viewed here: [Fakestore](https://johncoryk.github.io/ehouse-fakestore/).

## Tech used:

- HTML
- CSS
- SVGs for icons

You'll notice that the list of tech used this time is much shorter. In hindsight, these should have been the tools I used from the very beginning. Looking back, I feel as though React became an obstacle, not a useful tool in this process. Not only did I work faster without having to set up React components, but I got to see the bigger picture of how the page should be laid out. This helped inform my CSS decisions later on in the process.

## Process, wins, and losses:

Unlike the first go, this page is FULLY responsive. I led with a mobile-first development approach as I usually do, and as it usually does, it paid off in the final product.

Taking a look at the previous attempt, I'm truly disappointed in the attempt and can see why others felt the same. There are several details that I took special care to not only include, but also style appropriately.

- The full mobile and desktop versions of the header and nav are in place and styled correctly.
- There are SVG icons that look much better than the previous image icons.
- The search bar at the top is an actual search bar with the appropriate icon, placeholder text, and styling applied.
- I took great care to match the button styling as perfectly as I could to the mockup.
- To add a better user experience, hover states are smooth, stylish, and appropriate.
- I used pseudo-elements to place icons in the header to eliminate the need for unnecessary markup.

I'm **proud** of this attempt. I feel that it shows several signs of a good developer, but also a good team member.

I'm proud that I was able to take a step back, cut unnecessary tooling, and focus on the things that make the page work (HTML and CSS). I'm proud that I was able to take feedback to heart and improve my page layout design and process, showing that whether it be a client or colleague, I can get the job done right. I'm proud for keeping the attention to detail that landed me my current role--this page has been tested on various screen sizes, computers, and phones to ensure it's correct and responsive.

Mostly I'm proud that I pushed myself to be the **_'better than junior'_** developer that I know I can be!

I hope this all shows. Thank you for taking a look.
